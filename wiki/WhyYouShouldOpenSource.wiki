#summary Why contributing to an open-source community makes sense for studios and artists.

= Why you should consider open-source =

There are a number of reasons why joining an open-source community, and making in-house tools and scripts available via an open-source license makes sense for artists and studios.

  # Increased chance of having bugs identified and fixed.
  # Increased chance that someone will suggest features and improvements for your tool.
  # You can get feedback and support more quickly. 
  # You profit from other people's contributions, and are informed quickly when they make updates. 
  # Other people may port your tools to other platforms.
  # You can leverage powerful issue tracking, versioning, and collaboration tools for free.
  
The more we pull together to help each other as a community the more valuable it becomes.

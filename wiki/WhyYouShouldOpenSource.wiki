  * Increased chance of having bugs identified and fixed.
  * Increased chance that someone will suggest features and improvements for your tool.
  * You can get feedback and support more quickly. 
  * You profit from other people's contributions, and are informed quickly when they make updates. 
  * Other people may port your tools to other platforms.
  * You can leverage powerful issue tracking, versioning, and collaboration tools for free.
  
The more we pull together to help each other as a community the more valuable it becomes.

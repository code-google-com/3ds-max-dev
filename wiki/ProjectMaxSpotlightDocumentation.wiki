= How to use =


*3Ds Max - Typing* (see Figure 1.)
 1. Open the Listener to see search results (see Figure 2.)
 1. Type into the text box
 1. All objects which include the string will be listed
 1. Press Enter to select all listed objects

*3Ds Max - Drag & Drop*
 1. You can drag text into the text box
 1. If an object matches the string, it will be selected.

*General*
 * Entry supports wild cards. (e.g.: Sph*re)
 * on an exact match it will always select it
 e.g.: you have two nodes _sphere01_ and _sphere01a_ and enter "sphere01", it won’t select both objects, only the one matching exactly the object name
 * if multiple nodes have the same name and you type an exact match, both nodes are selected
 e.g.: you have three nodes _sphere01_, _sphere01_ and _sphere01a_ and enter "sphere01", it will select both nodes _sphere01_, but not _sphere01a_

*<br/>*

 Delays the printing to listener if your last pressed key is was typed within a certain time.
 Give it a value of 0 if you don't want to wait.

 0 will deactivate the limit.

*<br/>*
= Last thoughts =
Handy tool and time saver if you have an node naming convention established.
Some tools I use, print node names to the listener.
I now can double click to select the node name and drag & drop them over to `MaxSpotlight` to select the node

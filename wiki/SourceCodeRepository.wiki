#summary Using the Source Code Repository

= Introduction =

All source code on 3ds-max-dev is hosted using a version control system called Subversion or SVN for short. Accessing the latest code can be done easily at any time using an SVN client. 

For Windows users who have no experience with SVN I'd recommend using [http://tortoisesvn.net/ Tortoise SVN Client] which integrates smoothly with Windows explorer. 

The configuration information for accessing the Google code project SVN host is at http://code.google.com/p/3ds-max-dev/source/checkout. 

You do not need a Google account to download a copy of the code repository (a process called synching).

#summary How to join the 3ds Max developer community

= Joining the Community =

There are four levels of involvement in the cmomunity:

  # *Non-members* - Anybody can access the source code repository. For more information see SourceCodeRepository.
  # *Basic members* - The most basic level of involvement in the community is to join the [http://groups.google.com/group/3ds-max-dev-discuss Google discussion group]. Basic members do not have commit privileges. If they have something to share, they should inform the discussion group, and someone with commit privileges will contact them directly to make the commitment on their behalf. 
  # *Committers* - Members can request to have commit privileges to SVN via the [http://groups.google.com/group/3ds-max-dev-discuss Google discussion group]. People are granted commit privileges if their request is accepted by a majority of committers. Generally people will be assigned commit privileges once they have demonstrated active involvement in the 3ds Max developer community (this is not restricted solely to this site). 
  # *Project Owners* - Project owners are effectively [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_For_Life benevolent dictators]. Project owners are benevolent because of the nature of open-source projects: anyone who doesn't like how things are run are free to start their own clone of a project as long as they respect the original license.

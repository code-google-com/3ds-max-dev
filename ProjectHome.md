**NOTE: As of January, 2014, Google Code no longer supports new downloads and is in read-only mode.  Example code for the Learning Path for 3ds Max 2015 and later is now hosted at the ADN-DevTech repository on GitHub, or can be obtained as a zip file from the 3ds Max SDK Documentation web site.**

A collection of open-source plug-ins and scripts for 3ds Max contributed by the developer community. This project is intended as both a learning resource for 3ds Max developers and to help accelerate their plug-in and script development.

Currently this project hosts a number of template and basic tutorial plug-in projects for use with the 3ds Max SDK (2012-2014).

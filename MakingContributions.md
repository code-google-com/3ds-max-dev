# Making Contributions #

For reasons that are hopefully obvious we can't give commit privileges to just everyone right off the bat. We ask that you start by joining the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/3ds-max-dev-discuss), introducing yourself, and describing what you want to share.

Your first contribution will likely be made on your behalf by someone else with commit privileges, depending on the circumstances.

We are looking for any C++ source code that uses the 3ds Max SDK or any MAXScript code. The only requirement is that your code is licensed to be used under the [New BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).

To license your code you simply need to add a [copyright and license notice to your source code files](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).
